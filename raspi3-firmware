# Main baremetal application that is started by the firmware once the
# hardware has been initialized. Usually, this is the Linux kernel but
# this can also be u-boot or barebox launched as a second level
# bootloader. Possibles values are "auto", so the kernel image will be
# autodetected from /boot and started directly by the firmware, or the
# name of the image to use from /boot/firmware
#KERNEL="auto"

# Pass initramfs address as parameter of the KERNEL image.
# If you don't intend to pass an initramfs to the image started by the
# firmware, simply because you have a custom kernel that ships an
# initramfs or because it will be handled by a second level bootloader
# (like u-boot), set it to "no". Possibles values are "auto", so the
# initramfs image will be autodetected from /boot and pass as parameter
# of the KERNEL image. It can also be set to "no", in this case no
# initramfs will be handled at all by the firmware.
#INITRAMFS="auto"
